# 3D Visualization of Sea Level Rise in the United States


## Business Understanding:

### This project aims to visualize the sea level rise in the United States using 3D visualizations. 

#### The project focuses on two main parts:

1. Time-series 3D Visualizations: Create time-series 3D visualizations using Uber's Keplergl API to observe sea level rise in centimeters from 1980 to 2019 across important coastal regions in the United States, such as Florida, Massachusetts, and Hawaii. The sea level rise is presented in a 3D bar chart format for each location.

2. City and County Analysis: Create 3D surface plots to visualize the rising sea level for each city and county in the United States. This provides a more detailed and localized analysis of the sea level rise in different areas of the country.
   

## Results:

The project's outcome is a set of interactive and visually appealing 3D visualizations that enable a better understanding of the sea level rise across different regions in the United States. These visualizations can be used for educational purposes, to raise awareness about the impact of climate change, and to aid decision-making for policymakers and stakeholders involved in coastal management and infrastructure planning.


## Technologies Used:

### Programming Language: 
1. Python
   
### Libraries:
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Plotly
3. Matplotlib
4. Nltk
   
     
## Approach:

The project utilizes the Keplergl API, an open-source geospatial visualization tool, to create interactive and customizable 3D visualizations. The approach involves the following steps:

1. Collecting and Preprocessing Data: Collect and preprocess sea level rise data for different regions across the United States.

2. Integration with Keplergl API: Integrate the preprocessed data with the Keplergl API to leverage its capabilities for geospatial visualization.

3. Time-series 3D Visualizations: Use the Keplergl API to create time-series 3D visualizations, presenting sea level rise in a 3D bar chart format for each location.

4. City and County Analysis: Utilize the Keplergl API to generate 3D surface plots, allowing for a detailed analysis of sea level rise in different cities and counties.

5. Visualization Refinement: Customize and refine the visualizations to enhance interactivity and visual appeal.

6. Final Output: Generate a set of interactive 3D visualizations that provide insights into the sea level rise across various regions in the United States.
