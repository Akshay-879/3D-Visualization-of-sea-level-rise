# 3D-Visualization-of-sea-level-rise in united states.

## Description: 

This project aims to visualize the sea level rise in the United States using 3D visualizations. The project is divided into two parts. The first part involves creating time-series 3D visualizations using Uber's Keplergl API to observe sea level rise in centimeters from 1980 to 2019 across several important coastal regions in the United States, such as Florida, Massachusetts, and Hawaii. The sea level rise is presented in a 3D bar chart format for each location.

The second part of the project involves creating 3D surface plots to visualize the rising sea level for each city and county in the United States. This enables a more detailed and localized analysis of the sea level rise in different areas of the country.

The project utilizes Keplergl API, a powerful open-source geospatial visualization tool that allows for interactive and customizable visualizations of geospatial data. The project involves collecting and preprocessing sea level rise data for different regions across the United States, integrating the data with Keplergl API, and creating 3D visualizations.

The project's outcome is a set of interactive and visually appealing 3D visualizations that enable a better understanding of the sea level rise across different regions in the United States. The visualizations can be used for educational purposes, to raise awareness about the impact of climate change, and to aid decision-making for policymakers and stakeholders involved in coastal management and infrastructure planning.
