# 3D-Visualization-of-sea-level-rise in united states.

## Description: 
The project is divided in two parts where two types of visulizations are created for observing the sea level rise is 3D format:
1. Time-series 3D visualizations of sea level rise using uber's Keplergl API for several locations across the United States. Sea level can be observed from 1980 to 2019 across many important coastal regions in the united states like Florida, Massachusetts, Hawai etc. in 3-dimentional bar chart format in centimeters. 
2. 3D Surface plots to visualize the rising sea-level rise. The plots can be observed city wise and county wise.
